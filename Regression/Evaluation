To evaluate each model and decide which regression model is best for a database, we must calculate the adjusted R^2 coefficiant for each model and compare the scores.
The code below shows the method of evaluating a model based on R^2 coefficiant:
    from scikit.metrics import r2_score
    r2_score(dependent_variable_test_set, dependent_variable_predictions)
